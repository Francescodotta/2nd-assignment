#2NDASSIGNMENT
The two algorithms i created have to sort the numbers of a taken list in order.
With the quicksort algorithm i created an algorithm that takes a random quantity of number in a list, that algorithm will take a pivot,a defined number, and then the algorithm takes a number of the random numbers we choose and put it on the left of the pivot if the number is smaller than the pivot, or on the right if the number is bigger than the pivot. After made this passage, the algorithm will swap between the elements until it reaches the right order.

The mergesort algorithm basically will do the same passages of the quicksort algorithm but it will not use the pivot elements so the algorithm will divide every time until it arrives with a single number and then it will check every single number in the list and sort with the next element of that list

After i made those two algorithms , i used timeit that is a function that measures the time the two algorithms will take to sort all the elements in the list.I obtain the result of that function : quicksort is faster, but in the worst case of quicksort , mergesort will be better because it can deal with big data but will store much memory. I choose also a random list because i want to check if it's everytime in this way.
